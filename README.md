# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
- The purpose of this analysis is to visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch date and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
- To perfrom an analysis of theater outcomes based on launch date, I first added  a years column to Kickstarter data. This was to be able to filter the data for the pivot chart by Years and Parent Category(theater). The rows and colmuns of data would reflect the outcomes and outcome values by Each month. The following image reflects that. ![Theater_Outcomes-vs_Launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97639454/171269795-204a24d8-d64d-4b55-b053-2ac62f2bcb17.png)
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
- To perform an analysis of coutcomes based on goals, I started by first creating a new sheet and labeled it, "Outcomes Based on Goals". On this sheet, I created a data set that held Goal amounts based on the number and total of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns. It also held the percentages. The following image shows the sucesss rates. ![Outcomes_vs_Goals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97639454/171269899-e1b3a995-7e10-4a8f-b0d7-fe6d3357942b.png)

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- The challeneging part of the section of the launch date analysis was to filter just by the months. I was able to overcome this by removing other filter options.
- The challenging part of the section of the goals analysis was using the COUNTIF function to correctly filter the data to bring back a specific goal amount based on the outcome and subcatergory(plays). 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? The two conclusons I can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch date is that the campaigns were the most successful during May and June, and there was no cancled campaigns during October. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? The conlcusion I can make about the Outcomes based on Goals is that goal amounts for 45000 and above had a low success rate which resulted in a high failed rate. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset? The limitations of this dataset is that it not based on as specific dates or times of year. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? Another possible table and/or graph that we could create is one based on goal and amount and time of year.
